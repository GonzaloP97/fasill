% unfold/1
% unfold(+Rule)
%
% This predicate succeeds unfolding the FASILL
% rule +Rule. This predicate has the side effect
% of retracting the rule +Rule and asserting the
% new unfolded rules.

    once(retract(R1)),

      fail ; true ),
    sort_rules_by_id.

% unfold/2
% unfold(+Rule, ?Unfolded)
%
% This predicate succeeds when +Rule is a FASILL rule
% and ?Unfolded is an unfolded rule of +Rule.
:- dynamic(unfolding_id/1).
unfold(R1, R2) :-

% unfold_by_id/1
% unfold_by_id(?Id)
%
% This predicate succeeds unfolding the FASILL
% rule Rule with identifier ?Id. This predicate
% has the side effect of retracting the rule +Rule
% and asserting the new unfolded rules.
unfold_by_id(Id) :-
    fasill_rule(Head, Body, Info),
    member(id(Id), Info), !,
    unfold(fasill_rule(Head, Body, Info)).

% unfold_by_id/2
% unfold_by_id(?Id, ?Unfolded)
%
% This predicate succeeds when ?Id is the identifier
% of a FASILL rule Rule and ?Unfolded is an unfolded
% rule of Rule.
unfold_by_id(Id, Rule) :-
    fasill_rule(Head, Body, Info),
    member(id(Id), Info), !,
    unfold(fasill_rule(Head, Body, Info), Rule).
